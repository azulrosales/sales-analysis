# Sales Analysis and Customer Segmentation

Worked with a large sales dataset to analyze trends and extract insights using SQL and Tableau. I developed various SQL queries to extract specific subsets of data. Using Tableau, I developed an interactive dashboard to provide insights into sales performance, including trends over time, top-selling products, and regional breakdowns. Additionally, I performed customer segmentation using RFM analysis to identify key customer segments and optimize marketing strategies.
